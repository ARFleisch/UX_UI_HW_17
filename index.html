                    <p>I am a creative, detail-oriented person who enjoys the creation process. I moved into UX/UI design so I could use my creative talents to make websites and apps that are easy for people to use without losing the personal connection. <br>
                        <br>What I enjoy about design is creating something that is both functional and aesthetically appealing.  My background in floral design allows me to use my training in color theory, movement, and flow in my UI designs.<br>
                        <br>Based in Minnesota, I would enjoy working remotely or within the Twin Cities metro. I am looking for a position that is more focused on UI and Front-End Development.
